This is a Proposal for the Austin Pedicab Company.

# Background on the Austin Pedicab Co.

The Austin Pedicab Co. was created in 2015 by a group of veteran drivers. They each have multiple years of experience in the transportainment industry and wanted to come together to make a company they could be proud to call their own. They've proven their mettle on the streets of Austin, New Orleans, Chicago, St Louis, and Dallas. They are adept at safely weaving the huge crowds that descend upon SXSW, Austin City Limits, Lollapolooza, Ranger/Cowboys Games, The Jazz Heritage Festival, and Mardi Gras among many others.

#Position

Our employee owned Pedicab fleet is the only service available with a full roster of only veteran riders. We offer an easy to use webapp for booking a pedicab ride or special tour. 

# Goals

They are developing a webapp and website that will allow Users to hail a pedicab from anywhere just by inputing their number and pushing a button. It will eventually come with location services so the drivers get notified with an address to pick up at. 

They will also begin offering a booking service for food truck tours, margarita tours, pub crawls, bike yoga, bachelor/bachelorette parties, weddings, birthdays and for any other reason at all. 

#Issues

There are a large number of competitors who are offering similar services. Uber and Lyft have dominated the market on phone based transportation services. It will be a challenge breaking through the barriers of mass appeal they've created. The pedicab community itself is also very large, amassing over 500 vehicles and thousands more drivers. 

There is the also inherent danger of the text system failing or that it might not be possible at our level of funding. We have backup ideas in place for that eventuallity. 

#The Customers

We are looking to bridge the gap with Technology and Pedicab Transport Services. On our consumer side we will make it easy to hail a pedicab from anywhere in downtown Austin and have it show up within minutes. It will be a great tool for anyone visiting Austin from around the world (because it will come in a few different languages) and great for locals who want a ride but dont want to have haggle over the "local price".

We will also be a great tool for advertisers. Our mobile and if needed interactive ad space is viewable by tens of thousands of consumers a day at SXSW, Austin City Limits, and just a normal night in the downtown hustle and bustle. Our veteran riders can interact with their passengers to speak about the product and also have the option of promoting a social media campaign for your brand. They each have multiple years of experience in these promotions and can produce great content for ads.

Restaurants and other businesses could also be a part of our Partnering Program. We'll be looking for vineyards to sponsor wine tours, food trucks for their tour, bbq shops, punk venues. We can be endlessly flexible to what they are looking for.

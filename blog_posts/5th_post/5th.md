#"Safe"#

I've got a decently creative mind and, on occasion, an intellegent one. My roadblocks come from not knowing the dialogue and tools needed to create my works. I've spent almost all of the last 20 years practicing, writing, and performing music. I'm accustomed to the creative process there. I've learned a vast array of the expected and rather common musical ideas (Rhythms, keys, chords, techniques, styles, genres, subgenres, effects, recording styles, instrumentation, tunings, tempos, layering, sampling, and that ridicuous tool of a tool: Auto-tune. To name a few.)

My point here, is that I've found and taken the time to understand these tools. To understand these concepts, theories, and rules. And I've done it for one purpose: *To learn how to bend and break them.* What I really enjoy in any kind of art is the ability of its creator to blend the expected with the abnormal. Especially if the abnormal is difficult to spot at first.

(Feel free here to replace "music" with whatever your preferred form of art may be, along with that art's particular terminology.)

Music is social. It's in the background or foreground or where ever it needs to be. It permiates our entire culture and every culture. It's a way to speak a thought or feeling across language barriers and vast oceans. The way we do that is by using accepted and understood concepts. In the western world we hear Major keys as uplifting and Minor keys as morose; it's basically the standard. We do almost everything to a 4/4 time signature. The guitars are usually tuned to E Standard, there's a kick on the 1 and 3, and a snare on the 2 and 4. And just like John Travolta's [famous natural walking gait](https://goo.gl/skKDCL) in Saturday Night Fever, it's usually around 120 beats per minute. These things arent always random and you could spend lifetimes debating on why they exist; the important thing is to recognize that they do. 

Once you've done that an entire new world will open to you. The expression and emotion that music creates is built on all those things. Knowing that they exist is important because having a base to start from is important. Think of it kind of like playing tag as a child: you start at "safe", run around a bit, and then try to get back to "safe" without becoming "it". Music should be the same way. 

You need to start from some sort of base point; once you have established that point you're free to roam. But if you stay out there forever, well that's just no fun. You've become that kid who would run home or fake a knee scrape when someone caught him.

You _haaate_ this kid.

He's not playing the game. And he's a jerk. And he doesn't understand that in order to have fun he has to make it back to "safe". And sometimes he has to be "it". You can't ignore the rules, but if you need to do a barrel role or piroute to avoid capture, go for it. Do anything you can imagine. But you eventually have to come back to "safe".

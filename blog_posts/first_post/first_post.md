#I dont want to make this about Inception

Really. I dont. It's the current cliche of cliches. I knew that every day would be a build on top of the day before, but I wasn't ready. "Not like this....." (Matrix reference.) (In case you missed it.)

Every day it seems our instructor, Sam, says "But, wait. There's more!" And each time I expect Leonardo Dicaprio to bust in like the Kool-Aid Man through the wall saying "We have to go deeper!"

Now there's a visual.

Things are going exceptionally well, though. For the most part. Since this is the first school I've been to in almost a decade (and definitely the first school I've cared to learn) I'm having to teach myself study techniques and force myself to carve out time for it all. Which is difficult. It's been interesting figuring out the struggle between homework, working downtown, band practice/shows, and seeing my friends/girlfriend. Not the easiest balance. 

I have performed a seach of the google and prepared a series of images that I feel appriately display my current feelings on the past two weeks.

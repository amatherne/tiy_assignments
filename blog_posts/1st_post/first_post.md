#I dont want to make this about Inception

Really. I dont. It's the current cliche of cliches. I knew that every day would be a build on top of the day before, but I wasn't ready. "Not like this....." (Matrix reference.) (In case you missed it.) Every day it seems our instructor, Sam, says "But, wait. There's more!" And each time I expect Leonardo Dicaprio to bust in through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man saying "We have to go deeper!" Or maybe he's like the Agents in the Matrix; suddenly one of us morphs into him mid-class and he asks us "What is the Div?"

Now there's a visual.

Things are going exceptionally well, though. For the most part. Since this is the first school I've been to in almost a decade (and definitely the first time I've cared to learn at one) I'm having to teach myself study techniques and force myself to carve out time for it all. Which is difficult. It's been interesting figuring out the struggle between homework, working downtown, band practice/shows, and seeing my friends/girlfriend. Not the easiest balance. My sleep schedule, which in all fairness was terrible before, is taking a brutal hit. 

I haven't really had my "Come to Jesus" moment yet, where everything clicks and i ridicule myself for being an idiot. But it's gonna happen. I know that one day I'll wake up and it'll just make sense. Probably after my next dream where I'm like a wizard, but my spells are all html tags. Which, lets be honest, would be a pretty cool movie to watch. Oh wait, they already made that movie. 

I have performed a seach of the google and prepared a series of images that I feel appriately display my current feelings on the past two weeks. I have no idea how to make them work. So....

We have to go deeper...
